# Matrix-Method
Matrix Method on Coursera
Mathematical Matrix Methods lie at the root of most methods of machine learning and data analysis of tabular data.  Learn the basics of Matrix Methods, including matrix-matrix multiplication, solving linear equations, orthogonality, and best least squares approximation.   Discover the Singular Value Decomposition that plays a fundamental role in dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis, and noise reduction.  Optional examples using Python are used to illustrate the concepts and allow the learner to experiment with the algorithms.
